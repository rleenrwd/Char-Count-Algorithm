# Character Counter

A simple Python script to count each alphanumeric character in a given string. By Robert L. Norwood

## Features

- Counts only alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`)
- Ignores whitespace, punctuation, and symbols
- Case-insensitive (i.e., `H` and `h` are counted the same)
- Simple and readable code

## How It Works

The `char_count` function iterates through the input string and uses a dictionary to keep track of how many times each alphanumeric character appears.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

This script was written as part of my ongoing effort to practice fundamental algorithms and improve my Python skills. Itâ€™s a simple but effective exercise in:

- String manipulation
- Control flow
- Dictionary usage
- Writing clean, readable code
